Hello GeoFS Community,

Please note that this addon does require tampermonkey. 

This is a very basic but important addon that is used to play a sound in your geofs game whenever you wanted to turn the seatbelt sign on or off. When the sign is red, that indicates that the sign is off. When the sign is green, that indicates that it is on. If you would like to hide the toggle, press the "." key on your keyboard. 
If you would like to change the keyboard bind that will be used to toggle the hiding/showing of the Seatbelts Fastened Button, feel free to edit your individual tampermonkey script. 

With that, enjoy this freeware addon for GeoFS!
